# gha-auto-project-assignment

Test to automatically move a newly created issue to a given project board.

Mind [this extra info](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/assign-to-one-project#organisation-or-user-project) when trying to use this with Organisation Projects or User Projects (rather that Repository Projects).

Uses this GHA:

Alternatives that I did not try:
- https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-project-automation (see also [further docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/moving-assigned-issues-on-project-boards))
